    h2 Disclosures
    small Last updated November 15, 2022.
    p I strongly believe in clear disclosures by journalists and others writing about cryptocurrencies and related topics. All outlets publishing cryptocurrency-related articles should have very clear and prominently-displayed disclosure policies.
    p I own small amounts (less than $500 worth at time of purchase) of crypto tokens or other crypto assets, which belong to an undisclosed address I use for research purposes. These do not represent a significant portion of my assets, and are used primarily to access token-gated projects and experiment with smart contracts rather than for any attempt to earn a return. If I do somehow end up with more money than I put in as a result, I intend to donate it.
    p As of November 1, 2022, I am a Fellow at Harvard's&nbsp;
      a(href='https://lil.law.harvard.edu/', target='_blank') Library Innovation Lab
      | , which will be supporting me in continuing my work for a year. This fellowship is enabled by the&nbsp;
      a(href='https://lil.law.harvard.edu/about/democratizing-open-knowledge', target='_blank') Democratizing Open Knowledge
      | &nbsp;program, which is funded by the&nbsp;
      a(href='https://ffdweb.org/', target='_blank') Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web
      | , a "nonprofit organization committed to preserving humanity's most important information by fostering the development of open-source software and open protocols". As the name suggests, they are organized around the&nbsp;
      a(href='https://fil.org/about/') Filecoin
      | &nbsp;project, which is a cryptocurrency/blockchain project. Although my focus at the LIL will not involve Filecoin specifically (unless it independently happens to crop up in my work), I still wish to disclose it as a potential conflict of interest, should it come up.
    p I have a&nbsp;
      a(href='https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/', target='_blank') Substack
      | , where some enormously generous people support my work. This includes the writing and research I do pertaining to crypto, as well as all of my other various and sundry interests. There is more detail on this in&nbsp;
      a(href='https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-0', target='_blank') Issue 0
      | &nbsp;of my newsletter,&nbsp;
      a(href='https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/', target='_blank')
        i Whitespace
      | .
    p I don't post sponsored content on my&nbsp;
      a(href='http://web3isgoinggreat.com/', target='_blank') Web3 Is Going Great
      | &nbsp;project, its associated Twitter account, this website, my blog, my personal Twitter account, or anywhere else. This will not change. No, I won't promote your project regardless of whether there is money changing hands, so please don't ask.
    p A few generous people have sent money for W3IGG's cloud hosting and various other upkeep costs, which I otherwise pay out of pocket. There is more information on this, along with a brief expenses report, at the&nbsp;
      a(href='https://web3isgoinggreat.com/contribute', target='_blank') W3IGG&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;Contribute
      | &nbsp;page. I don't run ads or otherwise directly monetize the site or my blog.
    p With respect to investments: I hold no long or short positions pertaining to cryptocurrencies or crypto-related companies. I do have some investments in the stock market and other traditional forms of finance, which I pay someone much smarter about and more interested in finance than I am to handle.
    hr
    p While we're here, I'll mention that I don't speak on behalf of an employer or anyone else. I hope it goes without saying, but just to say it: nothing I say should be taken to be financial, investment, legal, professional, or any other kind of advice.
