    h2 Disclosures
    p I strongly believe in clear disclosures by journalists and others writing about cryptocurrencies and related topics. All outlets publishing cryptocurrency-related articles should have very clear and prominently-displayed disclosure policies.
    p 
      | I own small amounts (less than $500 worth at time of purchase) of crypto tokens or other crypto assets, which belong to an undisclosed address I use for research purposes. These do not represent a significant portion of my assets, and are used primarily to access token-gated projects and experiment with smart contracts rather than for any attempt to earn a return. If I do somehow end up with more money than I put in as a result, I intend to donate it.
    p I have a
      a(href='https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/', target='_blank') Substack
      | , where some enormously generous people support my work. This includes the writing and research I do pertaining to crypto, as well as all of my other various and sundry interests. There is more detail on this in

      | Besides the general Substack support, I am not paid to write about cryptocurrencies or related topics, nor am I paid to create my
      a(href='http://web3isgoinggreat.com/', target='_blank') Web3 Is Going Great project
      | . I don't post sponsored content on that website, its associated Twitter account, this website, my blog, my personal Twitter account, or anywhere else. This will not change. No, I won't promote your project regardless of whether there is money changing hands, so please don't ask.
    p A few generous people have sent money for W3IGG's cloud hosting and various other upkeep costs, which I otherwise pay out of pocket. There is more information on this, along with a brief expenses report, at the

    p With respect to investments: I hold no long or short positions pertaining to cryptocurrencies or crypto-related companies. I do have some investments in the stock market and other traditional forms of finance, which I pay someone much smarter about and more interested in finance than I am to handle.

    p While we're here, I'll mention that I don't speak on behalf of an employer or anyone else. I hope it goes without saying, but just to say it: nothing I say should be taken to be financial, investment, legal, professional, or any other kind of advice.
