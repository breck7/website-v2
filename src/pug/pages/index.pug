        | I am an experienced software developer and technical lead. I currently lead a team developing the frontend experience for <a href="https://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HubSpot</a>'s developer tools and documentation.
      p
        | I am also a longtime editor of the English Wikipedia, where I edit under the username 
        a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GorillaWarfare') GorillaWarfare
        | . I am an administrator and&nbsp;
        a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Functionaries') functionary
        |, as well as a former member of the 
        a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee') Arbitration Committee
        | , on which I served three terms. I care deeply about providing free and open access to high-quality information, and this is something I try to do both through my Wikipedia activities and various other projects (including&nbsp;
        a(href="/projects") these
        |).
      p
        | I am passionate about supporting members of underrepresented groups in technology, both as a part of and outside of my professional career. This applies both to people who work in or wish to work in technology, but also to those who simply wish to exist online without facing harassment and abuse.
