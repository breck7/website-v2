        | I am an experienced software developer and technical lead. I currently lead a team developing the frontend experience for <a href="https://www.hubspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HubSpot</a>'s developer tools and documentation.

        | I am also a longtime editor of the English Wikipedia under the username 
        a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GorillaWarfare') GorillaWarfare
        | . I am an administrator and former member of the 
        a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee') Arbitration Committee
        | , on which I served three terms. I care deeply about people having free and open access to high-quality information and learning opportunities.
      p
        | I am passionate about supporting members of underrepresented groups in technology, both as a part of and outside of my professional career. This applies both to people who work in or wish to work in technology, but also to those who simply wish to exist online without facing harassment or other abuse. In my free time, I can usually be found on the Internet, hanging out at home with my dog and two cats, or both.
